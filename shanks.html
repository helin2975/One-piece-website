            <ul>
                <li>"Red-Haired" Shanks is one of the Four Emperors (Yonko) of the New World and the captain of the
                    Red-Hair Pirates.</li>
                <li>Despite his laid-back and carefree attitude, Shanks is one of the most powerful pirates in the
                    world.</li>
                <li>He was once a member of the legendary Roger Pirates, serving under Gol D. Roger, the only pirate to
                    successfully reach Raftel and become the Pirate King.</li>
                <li>Shanks' influence extends beyond his strength, as his charisma and wisdom have earned him the
                    respect of both pirates and the Marines.</li>
                <li>His defining moment came when he met a young Monkey D. Luffy in the East Blue, inspiring Luffy to
                    become a pirate and giving him his treasured straw hat as a symbol of their bond.</li>

                    his use of Haki, particularly Conqueror’s Haki.</li>
                <li>Shanks has mastered all three types of Haki (Observation, Armament, and Conqueror’s), making him one
                    of the most formidable figures in the One Piece world.</li>

                <li>Without drawing his sword, Shanks demanded peace and even forced the Marines to retreat, showcasing
