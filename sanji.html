  <h1>Vinsmoke Sanji - The Straw Hat’s Chef and Fighter</h1>
  <div class="forbg">

    <h2>1. Background:</h2>

    <h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Sanji, also known as "Black Leg" Sanji, is the Straw Hat Pirates' cook and one of Luffy's most trusted
          crewmates.</li>
        <li>Born in the North Blue, Sanji was raised in the East Blue on the floating restaurant Baratie, where he
          trained
          under Red-Leg Zeff.</li>
        <li>His dream is to find the legendary All Blue, a sea where fish from every ocean gather, making it a paradise
          for chefs.</li>
        <li>Despite his aristocratic background as a prince of the Vinsmoke family, Sanji's heart lies with his crew,
          and
          his loyalty is as strong as his culinary skills.</li>
      </ul>
    </h3>

  <div class="forbg">
    <h2>2. Combat Style:</h2>

    <h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Sanji specializes in the use of his legs in combat, practicing a martial art called Black Leg Style (Kuro
          Ashi
          no Waza).</li>
        <li>His hands are strictly reserved for cooking, and he maintains that principle even in the heat of battle.
        </li>
        <li>Sanji’s kicks are powerful enough to shatter steel and light enemies on fire due to the friction from his
          rapid movements.</li>
      </ul>
    </h3>

    <h2>a. Diable Jambe:</h2>
    <h3>
      <ul>
        <li>By spinning rapidly, Sanji sets his leg on fire, increasing the damage of his kicks.</li>
      </ul>
    </h3>

  <div class="forbg">
    <h2>b. Sky Walk:</h2>

    <h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Sanji can run through the air by kicking off surfaces, a technique he learned to increase his mobility in
          combat.</li>
      </ul>
    </h3>

  <div class="forbg">
    <h2>c. Ifrit Jambe:</h2>

    <h3>
      <ul>
        <li>In the Wano Arc, Sanji's Diable Jambe evolves into the Ifrit Jambe, a far more powerful and hotter flame,
          increasing the impact of his kicks exponentially.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>3. Key Highlights of Sanji's Life:</h2>

    <h3>a. Rescuing Nami (Arlong Park):</h3>

    <h3>
      <ul>
        <li>One of Sanji’s earliest key moments was when he fought for Nami's freedom from Arlong.</li>
        <li>His dedication to his crewmates, especially the women, remains a defining characteristic.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>b. Sanji vs. Jabra (Enies Lobby):</h3>

    <h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Sanji delivers a decisive victory against Jabra using his Diable Jambe, demonstrating his unmatched kicking
          power and determination to protect his crew.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>c. Wano Arc:</h3>

    <h3>
      <ul>
        <li>In Wano, Sanji's combat abilities take another leap forward with the Ifrit Jambe.</li>
        <li>He also comes to terms with his Vinsmoke bloodline after receiving the Germa Raid Suit, which enhances his
          physical abilities, though he later chooses to destroy the suit after feeling it affects his humanity.</li>
      </ul>

  <div class="forbg">
    <h2>4. Character Development:</h2>

    <h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Sanji's personality is a mix of gentlemanly manners and fiery passion.</li>
        <li>His devotion to cooking and the ladies, especially Nami and Robin, often leads to humorous moments, but his
          heart is always in the right place.</li>
        <li>Sanji has grown from a chef with a dream to a pivotal fighter in the crew.</li>
        <li>His inner conflict between his Vinsmoke lineage and his desire to remain the caring cook of the Straw Hats
          is an essential part of his character arc.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>5. The Future of Sanji’s Journey:</h2>

    <h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Sanji continues to evolve as both a cook and a fighter. With the power of Ifrit Jambe and his newfound
          acceptance of his Vinsmoke bloodline, Sanji is stronger than ever.</li>
        <li>His loyalty to his captain and crewmates is unwavering, and his dream of finding the All Blue remains
          alive.</li>
        <li>Whether in the kitchen or on the battlefield, Sanji’s journey promises to be filled with even greater feats
          as he helps lead the Straw Hat Pirates toward their ultimate goal—the One Piece.</li>
